This repository contains code for interfacing with the DS18B20 Temperature sensor over Onewire Communication Protocol. The microcontroller used in this is STM32U545.
This repo only has the main file as all the required code to interact with the sensor is in the main file itself. While all the other files will be autogenerated by the IDE, and they do not require uploading.
